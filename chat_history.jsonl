{"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're expecting to see 200GB more of free space that isn't showing up when you run the `df` command, there could be several reasons for this discrepancy:\n\n1. **Unallocated Space**: The missing space might be unallocated. You can check this by using a partition manager like `gparted` or the `lsblk` command to see if there's unallocated space on your disk.\n\n2. **Reserved Space**: By default, Linux filesystems like ext4 reserve a percentage of the total filesystem space for the root user. This is to prevent a user from filling up the disk completely, which could cause system processes to fail. You can check the reserved space with the `tune2fs` command.\n\n3. **Filesystem Overhead**: Filesystems have overhead, including space used by the filesystem structure itself (like inodes and directories), which is not available for user data.\n\n4. **Hidden Files**: There might be hidden files or directories using up space. These won't show up with a regular `ls` command. You can use `ls -la` to list all files, including hidden ones.\n\n5. **Mounted Filesystems**: If you have other filesystems mounted within the filesystem you're checking, `df` will not include their space in the total. Ensure you're checking the correct filesystem or unmount nested filesystems to see their space separately.\n\n6. **Deleted Files**: If a large file is deleted while it is still open by a process, the space will not be freed until the process releases the file. You can check for such files using the `lsof` command.\n\nTo investigate further, you can start by running the following commands:\n\n```bash\nsudo lsblk\nsudo gparted\n```\n\nRemember to be cautious when using disk management tools, as improper use can lead to data loss.

You can use the `-l +100%FREE` option to extend the logical volume to use all the available free space in the volume group.\n\n3. **Resize the Filesystem**: After extending the logical volume, you'll need to resize the filesystem to make use of the new space.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for providing the output. It shows that there is indeed free space of approximately **215GB** after your `/dev/sda3` partition, which ends at **698GB**. The error you encountered when using the command `sudo parted /dev/sda resizepart 3 1782579199` suggests that the end sector you specified is still outside the device's capacity.\n\nGiven that your disk size is **913GB** and the sector size is **512 bytes**, the maximum number of sectors you can have is **1782579200**. Since the partitioning tool reports sizes in GB and we need to be careful with the GB to GiB conversion (where 1 GiB = 1024^3 bytes), let's calculate the correct end sector for the additional **214 GiB** you want to add:\n\n1. Calculate the size in bytes for 214 GiB:\n   $$ \\text{214 GiB} = \\text{214} \\times 1024^3 \\text{ bytes} $$\n\n2. Calculate the number of sectors (since each sector is 512 bytes):\n   $$ \\text{Number of sectors} = \\frac{\\text{214 GiB}}{512 \\text{ bytes/sector}} $$\n\n3. Perform the calculation:\n   $$ \\text{Number of sectors} = \\frac{\\text{214} \\times 1024^3}{512} $$\n   $$ \\text{Number of sectors} = \\text{214} \\times 1024^2 \\times 2 $$\n   $$ \\text{Number of sectors} = \\text{214} \\times 2048 \\times 1024 $$\n   $$ \\text{Number of sectors} = \\text{438304} \\times 1024 $$\n   $$ \\text{Number of sectors} = \\text{448790528} $$\n\n4. Add the number of sectors to the current end sector of `/dev/sda3`:\n   $$ \\text{New end sector} = \\text{Current end sector of sda3} + \\text{Number of sectors for 214 GiB} $$\n   $$ \\text{New end sector} = \\text{1363148766} + \\text{448790528} $$\n   $$ \\text{New end sector} = \\text{1811939294} $$\n\nHowever, since the new end sector exceeds the total number of sectors on the disk, we need to use the maximum possible end sector, which is **1782579199**.\n\nPlease try the following command, which uses the maximum possible end sector for your disk:\n```bash\nsudo parted /dev/sda resizepart 3 1782579199\n```\n\nThis should resize your partition to use the remaining free space on the disk.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "To extend the `/dev/sda3` partition without unmounting, you can use the `growpart` command, which is a Linux utility that allows you to extend a partition in a partition table to fill available space. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, ensure that `growpart` is installed on your system. If it's not, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you would use:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install cloud-guest-utils\n   ```\n\n2. Once `growpart` is installed, you can extend the `/dev/sda3` partition by running:\n   ```bash\n   sudo growpart /dev/sda 3\n   ```\n\nThis command will extend the third partition on `/dev/sda` to fill all available space. After extending the partition, you'll need to resize the filesystem as well. The command for this will depend on the type of filesystem you have.\n\nPlease note that while `growpart` does not require unmounting, it's always a good idea to ensure that you have backups of your data before performing operations that modify disk partitions. Additionally, if this is a root or boot partition, you may need to perform these operations from a live CD/USB to avoid issues.\n\nRemember to replace `/dev/sda` and `3` with the actual device and partition number if they are different in your case.

SQL Server is case-sensitive for object names, so you need to make sure that the user name matches the login name exactly. You can use the following code to check the login name and the user name in the master database:\n\n```sql\n-- Check the login name\nSELECT name FROM sys.server_principals WHERE name = 'In2CRM';\n\n-- Check the user name in the master database\nUSE master;\nSELECT name FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = 'In2CRM';\n```\n\n- The user 'In2CRM' does not have the permission to view the definition of xp_cmdshell.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with your code. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe error you are getting is because the `get_streaming_response` function returns a **coroutine object**, which is a special type of object that can be used to run asynchronous code. However, the `json` module cannot serialize coroutine objects, which means it cannot convert them into a JSON format.\n\nTo fix this error, you need to **await** the coroutine object and get the actual result of the `get_streaming_response` function. This will return a **string** object, which can be serialized by the `json` module.

SQLite is a **file-based** database that is embedded in the application and can only be accessed by the same process that created it.\n- MySQL requires more **configuration and administration** than SQLite, such as setting up a server, creating users, granting permissions, etc. SQLite is more **simple and lightweight**, requiring no installation or setup.\n- MySQL supports more **advanced features** than SQLite, such as stored procedures, triggers, views, full-text search, etc. SQLite has a more **limited functionality**, but it is faster and more portable.\n- MySQL is more suitable for **large-scale** applications that need to handle a lot of data and concurrent users. SQLite is more suitable for **small-scale** applications that need to store data locally and do not require a lot of concurrency.\n\nFor your use case, since you only want to store message history and do not need a lot of tables, SQLite may be a better option than MySQL. SQLite is easier to use and integrate with streamlit, and it does not require a separate server or network connection. However, if you plan to scale up your application or need more features and security, you may want to consider MySQL instead.\n\nI hope this helps you decide which database to use for your streamlit app. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. \ud83d\ude0a", "chatID": "7415ad90-1249-4e35-a29c-634495fa38ba", "subject": "Database choice for streamlit", "date": "2024-01-21", "messageID": "bf01a719-ce3e-478a-9035-7ba3253e60e7", "counter": 1}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, I am Luuk's personal assistant. I can help you with Python programming questions. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTo fill values in an insert statement in a safe manner, you should use **parameterized queries**. Parameterized queries allow you to pass values as placeholders, which are then replaced by the actual values at execution time. This prevents SQL injection attacks and ensures that the values are properly escaped and formatted.\n\nOne way to use parameterized queries in Python is to use the **psycopg2** module, which is a popular PostgreSQL database adapter. You can install it using `pip install psycopg2`. Here is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\n# Import the module\nimport psycopg2\n\n# Connect to the database\nconn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname=test user=postgres password=secret\")\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncur = conn.cursor()\n\n# Define the SQL query with placeholders\nsql = \"\"\"\n    INSERT INTO messages(messageID,chatID,role,content,subjectID,date)\n    VALUES(%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s);\n\"\"\"\n\n# Define the values as a tuple\nvalues = (message[\"messageID\"], message[\"chatID\"], message[\"role\"], message[\"content\"], message[\"subjectID\"], message[\"date\"])\n\n# Execute the query with the values\ncur.execute(sql, values)\n\n# Commit the changes\nconn.commit()\n\n# Close the cursor and the connection\ncur.close()\nconn.close()\n```\n\nI hope this helps.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "I see. In that case, you can use the **sqlite3** module, which is a built-in module in Python that provides an interface to the SQLite database. You can use it in a similar way as the psycopg2 module, but with some differences. Here is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\n# Import the module\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the database (or create one if it does not exist)\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\"test.db\")\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncur = conn.cursor()\n\n# Define the SQL query with placeholders\nsql = \"\"\"\n    INSERT INTO messages(messageID,chatID,role,content,subjectID,date)\n    VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);\n\"\"\"\n\n# Define the values as a tuple\nvalues = (message[\"messageID\"], message[\"chatID\"], message[\"role\"], message[\"content\"], message[\"subjectID\"], message[\"date\"])\n\n# Execute the query with the values\ncur.execute(sql, values)\n\n# Commit the changes\nconn.commit()\n\n# Close the cursor and the connection\ncur.close()\nconn.close()\n```\n\nNote that the placeholders for sqlite3 are `?` instead of `%s`, and the values are passed as a tuple instead of a list. Also, sqlite3 does not require a password to connect to the database, unless you have encrypted it.\n\nI hope this helps.

I can help you with various tasks such as writing code, generating content, finding information, and more. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTo have a default value for a date column with the actual time when a row is added in sqlite3, you can use the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` keyword. This will insert the current date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. For example, you can create a table like this:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE test (\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  name TEXT,\n  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\nThen, when you insert a new row, you can omit the `created_at` column and it will be automatically filled with the current time. For example:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO test (name) VALUES ('Alice');\n```\n\nTo see the result, you can query the table like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM test;\n```\n\nThis will output something like this:\n\n| id | name  | created_at          |\n|----|-------|---------------------|\n| 1  | Alice | 2024-01-22 21:13:05 |\n\nI hope this helps.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to search a string for a certain text value in VBA is to use the **InStr** function. The InStr function returns the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string. If the substring is not found, it returns zero. For example, the following code snippet searches for the word \"hello\" in the string \"hello world\" and prints the result:\n\n```vba\nDim str As String\nDim sub As String\nDim pos As Integer\n\nstr = \"hello world\"\nsub = \"hello\"\n\npos = InStr(str, sub)\n\nIf pos > 0 Then\n    Debug.Print \"Found \" & sub & \" at position \" & pos\nElse\n    Debug.Print sub & \" not found in \" & str\nEnd If\n```\n\nThe output of this code is:\n\n```\nFound hello at position 1\n```\n\nYou can also specify the starting position and the comparison mode for the InStr function.
